# Coding Style Guide

### JavaScript
- A set of linting recommendations can be found in `.eslintrc`. This includes suggestions for *spacing*, *qutoation*, *types*, etc.
- Write JS code using ES6 tools like [const](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const), [let](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) and [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).
- Compare submitted code to existing reviewed code to verify that the style matches well.
- Try to be efficent, but not so efficent that your code can't be deciphered easily by humans.
- Always write tests for your code. Tests are written using [cucumberjs](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js). **All tests must pass.**
